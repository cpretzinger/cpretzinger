- 👋 hi, i’m @cpretzinger aka craig
- 👀 i’m interested in being happy - i wish it upon you too, (and u2 - go edge)
- reconnecting with that kid who took apart his Apple ][e
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ml, ai, always marketing
- 💞️ We're in the 60s of the information age
- while they sleep, i continue woken to an awe-inspiring world
- the problems, the pain, the suffering will shift
- as those of us awake, not woke ;) -- for clarity -- thanks adhd
- where was I?
- so goes the attention, and it reverts, is attracted, and more recently
- DRIVEN towards consumption of ai, code, and projects
- do i know what i am doin here?
- i do not and i do know that i improve from the repeated failures
- why, just yesterday it was EASIER to learn and deploy a cf worker
- than using zapier -------> ###gains
- so what i'm saying, (say what you will...)when something fascinates me like that fucking apple ][e ===>
- it propells me -- aka since gpt3 - i have been IMMERSED.
- there it is...where's the next place? fully auto-mated q-bit driven tech with more compute from one 'machine' than all of our computers COMBINED.
- we are in an amazing time...let's avoid fucking this one up folks.
- 📫 How to reach me email: craig@pretzinger.com subj: HOVERCRAFT {{your_text_description}}
