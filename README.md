# Craig Pretzinger

**Entrepreneur | Author | Builder | AI Optimist**

I build technology that liberates rather than enslaves. My mission: shift the world from passive consumption to active creation.

## What I Believe

Technology should serve humans—not the other way around. The best automations aren't about replacing people; they're about freeing people to do what actually matters: connect, create, and build something meaningful.

## What I'm Building

**[Boss Claude](https://github.com/cpretzinger/boss-claude)** - A gamified AI orchestration CLI that turns Claude into a delegating conductor. Because AI should amplify your capabilities, not just answer questions.

**SaaS Platforms & Intelligent Automations** - Tools that help businesses scale without losing their soul. Systems that work *for* you while you sleep.

## Philosophy

> "I don't get XP for talking. I get XP for shipping."

The best ideas are worthless without execution. I optimize for shipping real things that solve real problems for real people.
